# Underfloor heating

Underfloor heating provides 60% of it's heat output as radiation - see low temp heat articles.

Pipe spacing

take the heat loss of the room, add 20% for intermittent heating

divide by usable floor area to give W/m2 required (exclude areas under kitchen cabinets)

work out floor output W/m2K

- manufacturer tables 

make sure max floor temps are not exceeded


max floor surface temperature

- occupied spaces: +9C above target room temperature (100 W/m2)
- peripheral zones: +15C above target room temperature (175 W/m2)
- typical vinyl + timber 27C (75 W/m2 @20C room)

Floor maximum

Q = 8.92 x surface to air temp DT ^ 1.1
Q = Power Output
1.1 logarithmic curve of output
8.92 = u-value of the floor surface resistance


flow temperature vs floor temperature

- downward losses
- floor make up
- floor covering resistances
- pipe size
- pipe spacing

screed depth anything from 25-75mm
screed types

all floor coverings have a resistance value

deep pile carpet, wooden floor boards: 0.15 m2K/W
normal carpets and heavy parquet blocks: 0.1 m2K/W
parquet blocks, synthetic fibre, cork: 0.05 m2K/W 
ceramic, stone 0.0 m2K/W
underlay will also affect this.

0.2 m2K/W

100W/m2 * 0.2 m2K/W = 20K increase

larger bore pipe = more surface area and more power

tighter the pipe spacing
